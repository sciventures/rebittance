        To send a rebittance to your family, you must first exchange your dollars or euros for Bitcoin (BTC). It's a lot like any other currency, except that it's completely digital and there is no physical object like paper money. Unlike other currencies, its digital nature allows it to be transmitted across the world very cheaply.

          <p>Traditional remittances must move from 3 to 4 separate banking entities before finding their way to their intended recipients. At each step, certain fees are levied. Each bank must secure its respective network and facilities and this costs money.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin does away with this by only having a single entity in between the sender and the receiver. Additionally, the Bitcoin network is secured by users, and the responsibility of maintaining it is shared amongst hundreds of thousands of users.</p><br/>

        <div class='col-md-6'>
          <dl>
            <dt><h4 class='darkerbluetext'>Where can I buy Bitcoin in my area?</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>
              If you're in the US or EU, you will be able to buy Bitcoin directly from within the <a href="https://coinbase.com">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://circle.com">Circle</a>, or <a href="https://xapo.com">Xapo</a> wallets.
            </p>
            <p>If you live in other countries, the answer is a bit more varied. Try looking for <a href="http://coinatmradar.com/">a Bitcoin ATM</a> near you, or for <a href="https://localbitcoins.com">a local vendor</a>. Pay attention to their rates however, because these types of businesses will often add a small profit on top of the regular Bitcoin price.</p></dd>
            <dt>
              <h4 class="darkerbluetext">I heard that Bitcoin's price keeps changing and is unpredictable. Is that true?</h4></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The Bitcoin price is currently volatile, that is true. On any given week, the price of Bitcoin can change by 10%, sometimes even more. But the interesting thing about rebittance is that that doesn't matter. Rebittances use Bitcoin as a transmission system instead of as a way to store value, so neither you nor your recipient would be affected by price changes.</p>
              <p>If you convert your USD to BTC in the same hour that you plan to send it to the Philippines, for example, a big change in the price would be unlikely to occur. Importantly, it's the rebittance provider's responsibility to make sure that the agreed amount is exactly what the recipient eventually gets. </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <h4 class="darkerbluetext">My neighborhood remittance provider only charges me US$6 flat fee for a money transfer to the Philippines of any amount. Isn't that cheaper than the 1-2% offered by rebittance providers?</h4></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Although it's completely possible that your provider is simply the most affordable remitter in the world, the more likely explanation is that they are also making a <em>profit on the exchange rates</em> when they convert your money from USD to your home currency. Pay attention to the standard forex rates using a site like <a href="http://www.xe.com/">xe.com</a> and then compare that to the rates offered by your provider. You'll usually find that they are charging you an additional 1 to 1.5% on average.</p>
              <p>Research has uncovered the fact that some of the <a href="http://www.bankingtech.com/143292/remittances-a-window-to-the-future/">large banks charge up to 10% for their currency exchange services</a>.</p>
              <!-- <p>The bottom line is: pay attention to the rates if you don't want to waste your money unnecessarily.</p> -->

            <dt><h4 class="darkerbluetext">If banks and traditional remitters have hidden fees, don't rebittance services do too?</h4></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>It's important to remember that every rebittance provider is a separate business with separate business practices, so it's not possible to make a general statement about price transparency. As with everything else, it's important to pay attention and be aware of the potential pitfalls, so that you can make the most out of your funds.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><h4 class="darkerbluetext">How do I compare prices between remittance and rebittance providers?</h4></dt>
            <dd><p>
              It's sometimes very challenging to figure out which service is more affordable, because of the hidden currency exchange rates we mentioned earlier, and also because, generally speaking, math is hard.
            </p>
            <p>But there are some simple calculations you can use to allow you to do fast comparisons. The first step is to decide on the amount you want to send. <strong>The global average for Filipinos overseas is US$200 per monthly remittance, so that's often a good place to start.</strong></p>
            <p>So if your neighborhood remittance service is offering a US$6 flat fee, then their service is actually charging you 3%. ($6 divided by $200 is 0.03 or 3%.)</p>
            <p>Next you have to look at the exchange rate of US Dollars to Philippine Pesos (or your home currency) and then see how much lower the provider's rates are. For example, if the normal rate is 1 USD : 45 PHP, and you see that the service's rate is at 44 pesos, then you can tell that they are also charging an additional 2%. (1 peso divided by 45 pesos is 0.022, or roughly 2%.)</p>
            <p>So if the flat fee is 3% and the currency exchange is another 2%, your US$200 remittance is going to cost you 5%, or US$10.</p>
            <p>Armed with that knowledge, it'll be so much simpler to do comparisons.</p></dd>
