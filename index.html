    <h1>Let's make remittances cheaper.</h1>
    <p>In 2014, an estimated US$436 Billion will be sent by immigrants back to their families in the developing world.</p>
    <p>The total cost of sending all those remittances is estimated at US$42 billion or almost 10%.</p>
    <p><strong>Using Bitcoin, that number can be reduced to just US $5 billion, or 1.1%.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We call this REBITTANCE.</strong></p>

      <p>A huge portion of the money being sent by immigrants back home to their families is being lost to transfer fees and bank charges.</p>

      <p>The Bitcoin network allows us to send money safely and quickly, without incurring fees from Western Union, Moneygram, or other remittance providers. <small>[<a href="#">How</a>?]</small></p>

      <p>Try to imagine what the developing world could do with a savings of $42,000,000,000 each year.</p>

      <h1>How Does It Work?</h1>
      <p>To rebit money to your family, you must first exchange your dollars or euros for Bitcoin (BTC). This BTC can be exchanged back to cash just like any other currency, but it can be transmitted across the world very cheaply (unlike dollars or euros).</p>
